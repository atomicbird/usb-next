# usb-next #

This is an implementation of an adapter to let you run a NeXT keyboard over USB.

A great deal of credit goes to Limor Friedf, who [wrote a
tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-next-keyboard-with-arduino-micro/code)
that I used heavily in my early versions of this code. Parts of that code are
reused here under the BSD license.

I used this as a way to learn Arduino, and embedded software work, and hardware
reverse engineering. I don't think this code is especially well-structured or
thought out!
